## Machine translation using Bi-directional-RNNs



Here is what I do with this model:

* EDA the data set and analysis</br></br>

* Using BRNN to create a model and test</br></br>

* Test the accuracy, Let the user input and translate text result</br></br>

* finetuning the dataset and model</br></br>

* Result after finetuning</br></br>

* Build a model from scratch, train the model with the custom dataset, and compare the result with the pre-trained model using seq2seq</br></br>

**After experimenting with the model and creating the model**</br>
**It was found that the provided model gave the best Accuracy value at 0.8346. If the amount of data in training was increased than this, the Accuracy value would also increase. As for the model that was created by itself, it can be used as well. But it's not as good as Bi-directional-RNNs model**
